# Knight-s-Travail-Shortest-Path
To find the shortest path between two squares that a knight can take.

The Knights Travail is a problem in finding the shortest path between two squares on a chess board as travelled by a knight. A knight can move to a square that is two squares horizontally and one square vertically, or two squares vertically and one square horizontally. The coordinates are represented in standard notation. This uses a uniform cost search : a Breadth First Search with each move on the chess board being having an equal cost, so the shortest path will always have the least number of moves.
